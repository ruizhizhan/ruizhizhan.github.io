Hi there! I am a third year Ph.D student from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Daniel Koll](https://danielkoll.github.io/).

I am interested in the atmospheres on [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet), the worlds beyond the Solar System. As of December 2024, there were more than 5,700 confirmed exoplanets but characterizing their atmospheres remains a challenge for astrophysicists. Atmospheres make these exoplanets colorful and diverse, and potentially habitable for life.

Now I am working on modeling atmospheres on rocky exoplanets, utilizing 3D GCMs (Global Climate Model / General Circulation Model). Read more on my [researches](https://ruizhizhan.github.io/researches/).

You can find my [CV](https://ruizhizhan.github.io/files/cv_11_2024.pdf) here.
