I am a second year Ph.D student in PKU under the supervision of [Prof.Daniel Koll](https://danielkoll.github.io/). 

I am interested in [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet), the worlds beyond the Solar System. By April 2024, there were more than 5600 confirmed exoplanets but characterizing the atmosphere remains a challenge for scientists.

Now I am working on modeling atmospheres on different exoplanets, utilizing 3D GCMs (Global Climate Model / General Circulation Model). 

You can find my [CV](https://ruizhizhan.github.io/files/cv_04_2024.pdf) here.
