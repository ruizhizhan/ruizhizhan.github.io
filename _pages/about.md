Hi there! I am a third year Ph.D student at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Daniel Koll](https://danielkoll.github.io/). I was an undergraduate student of physics and astronomy at Wuhan University before I came to PKU (BSc 2022).

I am interested in the atmospheres on [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet), the worlds beyond the Solar System. As of May 2025, there were more than 5,900 confirmed exoplanets but characterizing their atmospheres remains a challenge for astrophysicists. Atmospheres make these exoplanets colorful and diverse, and potentially habitable for life.

My Ph.D project focuses on hot rocky exoplanets with ultra-short periods, as delineated in the red-boxed region of the figure below. Such planets are ideal targets for observations and provide critical benchmarks for the evolution of the planet systems.

Now I am working on modeling the atmospheres on rocky exoplanets, utilizing 3D GCMs (Global Climate Model / General Circulation Model). Read more on my [researches](https://ruizhizhan.github.io/researches/).

You can find my [CV](https://ruizhizhan.github.io/files/cv_05_2025.pdf) here.
