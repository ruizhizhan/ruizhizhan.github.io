Hi there! I am a second year Ph.D student from [PKU](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Daniel Koll](https://danielkoll.github.io/).

I am interested in [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet), the worlds beyond the Solar System. As of May 2024, there were more than 5,600 confirmed exoplanets but characterizing their atmospheres remains a challenge for astrophysicist. Atmospheres make these exoplanets colorful and diverse, and potentially habitable for life.

Now I am working on modeling atmospheres on exoplanets, utilizing 3D GCMs (Global Climate Model / General Circulation Model). 

- *Habitable zone around "dead stars"?* We use the ExoCAM Global Climate Model to investigate the inner edge of the habitable zone (HZ) around white dwarfs. Our results suggest **novel atmospheric dynamics expand the inner edge of the habitable zone around white dwarfs** and can be distinguished by JWST via thermal phase curve. Read more on the [accepted version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03189).
