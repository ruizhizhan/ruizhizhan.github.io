Hi there! I am a second year Ph.D student in PKU under the supervision of [Prof. Daniel Koll](https://danielkoll.github.io/).

I am interested in [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet), the worlds beyond the Solar System. As of May 2024, there were more than 5,600 confirmed exoplanets but characterizing their atmospheres remains a challenge for astrophysicist. Atmospheres make these exoplanets colorful and diverse, and potentially habitable for life.

Now I am working on modeling atmospheres on exoplanets, utilizing 3D GCMs (Global Climate Model / General Circulation Model). 

- Habitable zone around white dwarfs? <font size=3>We use the ExoCAM Global Climate Model to investigate the inner edge of the habitable zone (HZ) around white dwarfs. Our results suggest novel atmospheric dynamics expand the inner edge of the habitable zone ~10% closer to the star compared to previous studies on M dwarf planets. </font>
