Hi there! I am a 4th year Ph.D student at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Daniel Koll](https://danielkoll.github.io/). I was an undergraduate student of physics and astronomy at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) (BSc 2022). 

I have been longing for the universe and space since I was a child. This passion led me to choose physics as my major in college, where I was fortunate to join the Qibin Astronomy Program. Under the guidance of Prof. Zonghong Zhu (WHU) and Prof. Ran Li (NAOC, now BNU), I gained some hands-on experience in modeling strong gravitational lensing during my undergrad. Later by chance, I got to know and fell in love with the field of [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet), the worlds beyond the Solar System. 

Now I work on the atmospheres of exoplanets, mainly the small terrestrial ones. As of August 2025, more than 5,900 exoplanets had been confirmed, yet characterizing their atmospheres remains a challenge in modern astronomy. Nevertheless, atmospheric studies, including the chemistry and dynamics, are of central importance. Atmospheres provide crucial insights into how exoplanets form and evolve over time, which in turn help better understand the formation and evolution of Solar System planets. Atmospheres of exoplanets are diverse and make some of them potentially habitable for life.

My Ph.D project focuses on modeling the atmospheres of rocky exoplanets utilizing 3D GCMs (Global Climate Model / General Circulation Model). Read more on my [research](https://ruizhizhan.github.io/research/).

You can find my [CV](https://ruizhizhan.github.io/files/cv_05_2025.pdf) here.

Besides doing research, I love classical music (Chopin is my favorite!) and I play Erhu (a traditional Chinese string instrument) in PKU Chinese Orchestra. 

# News and Updates
- *April 2025*: I attended EGU and gave an [oral presentation](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu25-4751) titled "Modeling the Atmosphere of 55 Cancri e with a Non-grey General Circulation Model".

- *December 2024*: I attended AGU and gave an [oral presentation](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024AGUFMP23F...04Z/abstract).
- *August 2024*: My very first paper, **Novel Atmospheric Dynamics shape Inner Edge of Habitable Zone around White Dwarfs** was published in the Astrophysical Journal. In [this work](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad54c1), we use the ExoCAM global climate model to investigate the inner edge of the habitable zone around white dwarfs. We find tidally locked planets with ultra-short orbital periods (~ 1 day) around white dwarfs exhibit novel atmospheric dynamics, “bat rotation”, which differs from typical atmospheric circulation regimes around M dwarfs. The “bat rotation” regime expands the white dwarf habitable zone by ∼50% compared to estimates based on 1D models. 

- *March 2024*: I gave a talk at Wuhan University.
- *December 2023*: I attended the Exoplanet and Planet Formation Workshop and presented a poster.
- *June 2023*: I attended ExoSLAM and Exoclimes VI in U.K. and presented a poster "Novel Atmospheric Dynamics shape Inner Edge of Habitable Zone around White Dwarfs" (abstract [here](https://exoclimes.org/posters_2.pdf)).
