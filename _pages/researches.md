My work focuses on the Earths-like planets and super Earths, especially the tidally locked ones.

- *Habitable zone around "dead stars"?* We use the [ExoCAM](https://github.com/storyofthewolf/ExoCAM) Global Climate Model to investigate the inner edge of the [habitable zone (HZ)](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/what-is-the-habitable-zone/) around [white dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf). Our results suggest **novel atmospheric dynamics expand the inner edge of the habitable zone around white dwarfs** and can be distinguished by [JWST](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/) via [thermal phase curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_curve_(astronomy)). **Read more on the [accepted version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03189)**.

- *Different atmospheres on hot super Earths?* We use non-grey Global Climate Model, [Isca](https://execlim.github.io/Isca/) and [Socrates]( https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/socrates) to model the atmospheres on hot super Earths like TRAPPIST-1b, LHS3844b and 55 Cnc e.
