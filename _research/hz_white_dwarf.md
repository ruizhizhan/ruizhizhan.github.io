title: Habitable Zone Around "Dead Stars"?
---

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf">White dwarfs</a> are compact stars with a size comparable to Earth and a mass comparable to Sun. Planets in the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/resource/what-is-the-habitable-zone/">habitable zone</a> (read more <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11809380_Habitable_zones_around_main_sequence_stars">here</a>) around white dwarfs have **ultra-short orbital periods** ranging from hours to days. Due to the small size, white dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to search nearby stellar systems for signs of life. The habitable zone around white dwarfs, however, is still poorly understood. 

Here we use the <a href="https://github.com/storyofthewolf/ExoCAM">ExoCAM</a> Global Climate Model to investigate the inner edge of the habitable zone around white dwarfs. Our simulations show habitable planets with ultrashort orbital periods (P < 1 day) enter a <span style="color: #AD4344; font-weight: bold;">“bat rotation” regime</span>, which differs from typical atmospheric circulation regimes around M dwarfs. Bat rotators feature mean equatorial subrotation and a displacement of the surface’s hottest regions from the equator toward the midlatitudes.

From left to right: bat rotator (P = 0.5 days; this work), compared to a rapid rotator (P = 2 days), Rhines rotator (P = 10 days), and slow rotator (P = 20 days). Dynamical regimes for the slower rotating planets are defined as in [Haqq Misra et al. (2018)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa9f1f). In (a), “SP” corresponds to the substellar point. In (b), red vs. blue shading represent eastward vs. westward winds. The simulations assume a 10,000 K white dwarf and 2.12 times Earth’s instellation.</span><br><br><br>

We qualitatively explain the onset of bat rotation using shallow water theory. The resulting circulation shifts increase the dayside cloud cover and decrease the stratospheric water vapor, expanding the white dwarf habitable zone by ∼50% compared to estimates based on 1D models. The James Webb Space Telescope should be able to quickly characterize bat rotators around nearby white dwarfs thanks to their distinct thermal phase curves. Our work underlines that tidally locked planets on ultrashort orbits may exhibit unique atmospheric dynamics, and guides future habitability studies of white dwarf systems.
