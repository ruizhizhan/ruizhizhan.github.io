title: Habitable Zone Around "Dead Stars"?
---

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf">White dwarfs</a> are compact stars with a size comparable to Earth and a mass comparable to Sun. Planets in the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/resource/what-is-the-habitable-zone/">habitable zone</a> (read more about the habitable zone edges <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11809380_Habitable_zones_around_main_sequence_stars">here</a>) around white dwarfs have **ultra-short orbital periods** ranging from hours to days. Due to the small size, white dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to search nearby stellar systems for signs of life. The habitable zone around white dwarfs, however, is still poorly understood.

Here we use the <a href="https://github.com/storyofthewolf/ExoCAM">ExoCAM</a> Global Climate Model to investigate the inner edge of the habitable zone around white dwarfs. Our simulations show habitable planets with ultrashort orbital periods (P < 1 day) enter a <span style="color: #AD4344; font-weight: bold;">“bat rotation” regime</span>, which differs from typical atmospheric circulation regimes around M dwarfs. Bat rotators feature mean equatorial subrotation and a displacement of the surface’s hottest regions from the equator toward the midlatitudes.

From left to right: bat rotator (P = 0.5 days; this work), compared to a rapid rotator (P = 2 days), Rhines rotator (P = 10 days), and slow rotator (P = 20 days). Dynamical regimes for the slower rotating planets are defined as in [Haqq Misra et al. (2018)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa9f1f). In (a), “SP” corresponds to the substellar point. In (b), red vs. blue shading represent eastward vs. westward winds. The simulations assume a 10,000 K white dwarf and 2.12 times Earth’s instellation.</span><br>

The <span style="color: #AD4344; font-weight: bold;">“bat rotation” regime</span> expands the white dwarf habitable zone by ∼50% compared to estimates based on 1D models.

The James Webb Space Telescope should be able to quickly characterize bat rotators around nearby white dwarfs thanks to their distinct <a href="https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/">JWST</a> via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_curve_(astronomy)">thermal phase curves</a>. 

We also qualitatively explain the onset of bat rotation using shallow water theory. Read more here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03189">[arxiv]</a><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad54c1">/ [journal]</a>.<br><br>
