    The ultra-short period super Earth 55 Cancri e offers a unique opportunity to study planets in extreme environment. Despite extensive observation, the nature of 55 Cancri e, however, is still poorly understood. Few model with realistic radiative transfer has been employed for hot (non-habitable) rocky exoplanets, mainly due to the incompatibility of standard GCM radiative transfer codes with currently observed hot exoplanets. Here we calculate the absorption cross section from <a href="www.exomol.com">ExoMol</a> line lists. We develop custom correlated-k coefficients from the absorption cross section and validate them against line-by-line radiative transfer.

    <font color=grey size=2em>Absorption cross section of CO<sub>2</sub> at Earth Temperature (300 K) and typical temperature on substellar point of 55 Cnc e (3500K) assuming 1 bar pressure. The two lines are clearly distinguished. So the standard GCM radiative transfer for Earth cannot be applied to 55 cnc e. </font><br><br><br>
    We then perform GCM simulations with non-grey radiative transfer, <a href="execlim.github.io/Isca/">Isca</a> coupled with <a href="code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/socrates">SOCRATES</a>, to model the atmospheres on 55 Cancri e.<br>

    <font color=grey size=2em>The gas absorption in our model includes molecular spectrum (including UV absorption) and collision induced absorption (CIA). </font><br><br><br>
    Our simulations suggest the secondary atmosphere on 55 Cancri e should be <b>thick and carbon dioxide rich</b>.<br>
    Observations from Spitzer and JWST reported significant time variability in the secondary eclipse depth of 55 Cancri e. However, our result suggests that clearsky atmosphere variability is much weaker than observed.
